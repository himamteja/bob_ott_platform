## 🌩️ Project Overview

The OTT Streaming Application is a front-end project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
designed to replicate the look and feel of modern streaming platforms. 
This application features a clean interface with movie cards, category sections, 
a hero banner, and smooth hover animations, offering users a simple and visually engaging browsing experience.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate front-end development skills by creating a responsive 
and interactive UI without using any external frameworks. With a focus on layout design, 
styling, and basic JavaScript interactions, this project serves as a strong foundation for expanding into a 
fully functional OTT platform with backend and API integrations in the future.

## 🔧 How It Works

The user opens the application through index.html

The homepage loads movie banners, thumbnails, and categories

HTML displays the movie cards and sections

CSS styles the layout, animations, and hover effects

JavaScript handles interactivity like search, sliders, or dynamic content

When a user hovers on a card, UI effects highlight the movie

All content loads instantly as the project runs fully on the frontend
